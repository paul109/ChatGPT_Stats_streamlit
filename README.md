   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # .env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   HF_API_TOKEN=your_actual_hugging_face_token_here
   REQUEST_LIMIT=500
   ```
   
   **Get your API keys:**
   - **Gemini API Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey), create a new API key
   - **Hugging Face Token** (optional): Go to [Hugging Face Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), create a new token with "Read" access

   ```

5. **Use the app**
   - Follow the instructions in the app to export your ChatGPT data
   - Upload the `conversations.json` file
   - View your personalized insights!

### Deployment

#### Option 1: Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended - Free)

**Step 1: Prepare your repository**
```bash
# Make sure .env is not committed (check .gitignore)
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository
5. Set main file path: `streamlit_app.py`

   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_gemini_api_key_here"
   HF_API_TOKEN = "your_actual_hugging_face_token_here"
   REQUEST_LIMIT = "500"
   ```
8. Click "Deploy!"

**Important Security Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **Never commit your `.env` file** - it's already in `.gitignore`

   - `REQUEST_LIMIT`: 500
4. Deploy with one click

#### Option 3: Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables in the dashboard

## Privacy & Security

### Data Processing
- ‚úÖ **Local Analysis**: Basic statistics and usage patterns are calculated locally in your browser
- ‚úÖ **No Local Storage**: We don't store your conversations or personal data on our servers
- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: You can review all the code to understand exactly what happens to your data

### AI-Powered Insights (Optional)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Gemini API**: When using AI insights, your message content is sent to Google's Gemini API
- üìù **Data Minimization**: Only message content is sent (truncated to 100 words per message)
- üö´ **No PII**: No personal identifiers, timestamps, or conversation IDs are sent to Google
- üîÑ **One-time Processing**: Data is sent once for analysis and not stored locally

### Data Sent to Third Parties
- **Google Gemini API**: Message content for AI analysis (only if GEMINI_API_KEY is set)
- **Hugging Face**: AI-generated summary for portrait generation (only if HF_API_TOKEN is set)

### Privacy Options
- **Skip AI Features**: Don't set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to avoid sending data to Google
- **Local Only**: The app works without AI features for basic statistics
- **Review Policies**: Check [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Gemini API Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms) for current data handling practices

### Important Notes
- Data sent to Google is subject to their privacy policy and data retention practices
- While Google states they don't store API data for training, they may log usage for abuse prevention
- You control your own API keys and can revoke access at any time

## Cost & API Usage

### Your API Keys, Your Control
- **You pay**: Only for your own API usage when people use your deployed app
- **Typical costs**: Very low - Gemini API costs ~$0.001-0.01 per request depending on usage
- **No hidden fees**: You control your own API keys and can monitor usage in your Google/HF dashboards
- **Usage monitoring**: Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console to track costs

### Protecting Your API Keys
When you deploy, your API keys are:
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted** on the deployment platform
- ‚úÖ **Not visible** to app users 
- ‚úÖ **Not committed** to your GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ **Yours to control** - revoke or rotate anytime

### Optional: User-Provided Keys
If you prefer users to use their own API keys, you can modify the app to:
1. Accept API keys through Streamlit's `st.text_input()` 
2. Remove the environment variable loading
3. Use user-provided keys for API calls

This way users pay for their own usage, but requires more setup for each user.

## Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not found"
- Make sure you've created a `.env` file with your API key
- Check that the key is correct and active
- For deployment, verify the environment variable is set correctly

### "Error generating AI insights"
- Check your Gemini API quota and billing
- Verify your API key is valid
- Try refreshing the page

### "Could not find any messages"
- Make sure you're uploading the correct `conversations.json` file
- Check that the export completed successfully
- Try re-exporting your data from ChatGPT
